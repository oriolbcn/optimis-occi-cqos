     * each VM instance of a component has a specific contextualization image that must be mounted at VM
     * provisioning time. These component definitions have to be acknowledged by the infrastructure provider
     * in order to provide basic compliance with the OPTIMIS infrastructure. Additionally, a service manifest
     * document is passed to the {@link #deployService(String, java.util.List, eu.optimis.types.xmlbeans.servicemanifest.XmlBeanServiceManifestDocument)} method. An
     * infrastructure provider can use this document in order to provide full compliance with other OPTIMIS
