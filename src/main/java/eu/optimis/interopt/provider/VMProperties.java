 * The {@link VMProperties} specify basic monitoring properties of a particular VM instance. In order to be
 * compliant with the OPTIMIS infrastructure a provider MUST support monitoring of the provided virtual
 * machine instances. VM properties must at least specify the state of a VM and the id of the VM instance.
 * 
 * Additionally, an infrastructure provider SHOULD expose at least the following additional properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>occi.compute.hostname - the hostname/ip of the VM instance</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Besides this information the infrastructure provider may expose additional information, i.e. VM information
 * that is defined by the OCCI specification.
