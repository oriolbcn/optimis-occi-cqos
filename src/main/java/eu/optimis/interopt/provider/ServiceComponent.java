/**
 * A service component specifies the number of instances, CPU speed, memory, etc. of the VMs that should be
 * allocated for a component. It is a name value map that specifies the type (key) and the value (value) of
 * the component properties. The property names rely (as far as possible) on the OCCI specification. The
 * following properties are defined:
 * <ul>
 * <li>occi.compute.architecture</li>
 * <li>occi.compute.speed</li>
 * <li>occi.compute.memory</li>
 * <li>occi.compute.cores</li>
 * <li>eu.optimis.vm.image</li>
 * <li>eu.optimis.vm.contextualization.${instance-id} - the URI of the contextualization image for each VM
 * instance. The instance id is hereby a loop variable from 1..n, where n is the number of instances that
 * should be allocated (i.e. if n=2 there will be two properties - eu.optimis.vm.contextualization.1 and
 * eu.optimis.vm.contextualization.2).</li>
 * </ul>
 * All of the above mentioned properties must be specified for a component.
